Linda Clarke, 66 years old, was a "valued" colleague, with trust chiefs saying she brought "many new lives" into the borough of Wigan as a Midwife and will be "greatly missed", according to colleagues. She was a community midwife and a delivery suite co-ordinator at Royal Albert Edward Infirmary. She had worked in the maternity service for 30 years.
