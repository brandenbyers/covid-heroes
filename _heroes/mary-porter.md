Mary Ellen Porter, 65 years old, was a nurse manager at Richmond University Medical Center (RUMC), where she worked for more than 25 years. She fell victim to COVID-19 on April 9, 2020. Diane Donaghy, RN, president of the local bargaining unit at RUMC said “She was always there for her staff. In the good times, the bad times, when the floors got crazy, she was quick to put on scrubs and help them when needed.”
