Judy Wilson-Griffin succumbed to the virus on March 20th. The 63-year-old was the first person in St. Louis County to die of COVID-19.

> In mid-March, as news of the novel coronavirus spread across the country and organizations started canceling large gatherings, Wilson-Griffin drove to Indianapolis to attend a professional nursing conference. Griffin fussed at her mom for deciding to go despite the risk.
> 
> Griffin said this conference needed to be her last for a while.
> 
> The next week, Wilson-Griffin was hospitalized with pneumonia, a condition she had experienced before because of her lupus.
> 
> Wilson-Griffin told her daughter she might be able to see her once she was cleared by doctors. Griffin told her mom to keep her posted. She asked her daughters to pray for their nana.
> 
> The next day, Griffin texted her mom but heard nothing. She would eventually learn her mother had been sedated because her breathing had become labored. Wilson-Griffin was diagnosed with the virus on a Wednesday. By Friday, her dear friend Lesser suited up in protective gear to see her and to report back to the family.
> 
> The family never got to tell her goodbye.
> 
> The virus had caused her organs and health functions to shut down. Wilson-Griffin died before doctors could remove her from a ventilator.
> 
> She was buried with her late husband in Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis.
