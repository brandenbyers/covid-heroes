Gino Fasoli 09 12 1946 † 14 03 2020
Medico di medicina generale già in pensione richiamato per l’emergenza Covid-19 – Brescia

> "Gino, can you help us out? The surgeries are unmanned because so many of us went to the hospital to help our colleagues on the front lines or because they got sick. But patients need someone to listen to them. You can do it?" When asked to put on the white coat, he didn't hesitate for a moment. Answering yes to the call to arms. But Gino Fasoli, 73, a boundless medical curriculum - from which volunteer experiences in Africa stand out - remained infected by Covid-19. And he died in recent days at the San Rocco clinical institute in Ome near Brescia. Another doctor who joins the row that is getting longer and more fallen. White coats that remained in the ward and in the clinic. Among the sick and patients who have continued to assist, visit and medicate.
> 
> Fasoli was a resident of Passirano (Brescia) and for many years he was a family doctor in Cazzago San Martino. He also held the position of medical director of the Bornato emergency room, also in Brescia. Active supporter of Emergency, he also had experiences abroad with Doctors Without Borders. And in Africa he had even been kidnapped. They had taken him to cure sick people in a village, then released him. He had also been coordinator of the Transport Union for the Sick in Lourdes and President of Unitalsi of Brescia.
> 
> Fasoli was originally from Sulmona. He will be buried in Sulmona, where his family lives. Gino leaves his brother Gabriele, his sister-in-law Gabriella, and his granddaughter Anna Paola.

73 years old.
