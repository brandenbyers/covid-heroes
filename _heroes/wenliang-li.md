Dr. Li Wenliang, 34 years old, tried to sound the alarm about the deadly Coronavirus on social media but what initially silenced and detained, long before Chinese authorities admitted just how dangerous and deadly the virus was. He was arrested with seven other whistleblowers. Li was eventually vindicated, and allowed to speak with reporters from his hospital bed, where he was being treated for the virus. But the resumption of his efforts to warn the public at large were cut short when he died just days later. 

Li left behind his wife and one child.
