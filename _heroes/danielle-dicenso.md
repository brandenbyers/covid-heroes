> Dicenso fell ill last month with a fever and cough, symptoms known to be caused by COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
> 
> “She was on a shift where she had COVID patients, and she didn’t have a mask. She was very scared of going to work,” her husband David Dicenso told WSVN.
> 
> Dicenso told reporters he believes she became infected with the disease due to the hospital’s lack of safety measures, including personal protective equipment for its staff.
