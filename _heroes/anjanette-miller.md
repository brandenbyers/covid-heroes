Anjanette Miller, a veteran nurse of almost two decades, worked at two facilities in the Chicago area. Age unknown.

Miller initially went to the hospital in mid-March after contracting coronavirus-like symptoms. The nurse tested negative for coronavirus and was informed she had diabetes, a condition which Miller said she had been predisposed to.

Miller [posted a video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb1AiLnBVmo) in which she talked about her experience of testing negative and diabetes diagnosis. However, just days later, her coronavirus symptoms came back.

Miller died from coronavirus-related complications earlier this week. The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office ruled her death was from pneumonia due to a COVID-19 infection with hypertension and diabetes as contributing factors.
