Ernesto “Audie” DeLeon was an ADN at Bellevue Hospital, where he worked for over 30 years. On April 13, 2020, DeLeon lost his 13 day battle with COVID-19. A [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-loving-memory-of-ernesto-deleon) has been set up in his memory and to support his family.

Audie’s colleague Claire Martinez shared these memories: “During his tenure, he was an incredible inspiration and a mentor to hundreds of nurses, doctors and other clinical staff. He was an immensely kind soul with a humble demeanor. He will always be dearly loved by his friends who have become family, his coworkers, and relatives.”

Ernesto’s colleagues at Bellevue Hospital held a service in his honor, and [posted a portion of the remembrance on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=sSp0_py5Twk&app=desktop).
