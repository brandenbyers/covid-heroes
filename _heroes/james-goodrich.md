Famed pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. James T. Goodrich, who separated conjoined twins, died Monday.

Einstein College of Medicine attributed his death to complications associated with COVID-19.

Goodrich was 73 and a Grand View-on-Hudson resident.

A pioneer in his field, Goodrich developed a special method to separate twins conjoined at the skull â€” employing a multi-stage approach to complete the delicate work.
