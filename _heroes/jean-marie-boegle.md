France 3 Television reported that Dr Boegle had gone to his holiday home near Dijon (CÃ´te d'Or) in the Burgundy region of France two weeks ago, to get some rest.

Tired, and suffering from other health issues, he decided to get tested for coronavirus. He tested negative the first time, however, a week later, he tested positive for Covid-19. He went in to a coma and died soon after.

Women who had given birth with Boegle's help also flooded social media with messages and condolences for the family.
