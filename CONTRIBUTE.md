## Guidelines

### Coding Guidelines

We use the [United States Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) (USWDS) to build this site. Unless absolutely necessary, please avoid using custom `HTML`, `CSS`, or `JS` for an element or component that exists in the [USWDS](https://github.com/uswds/uswds).


### Content Guidelines

1. All profiles must include `name`, `country`, `date of death`, and `source`
1. If name is not known, use "Anonymous" and some identifier like City (eg. Anonymous Atlanta) or Employer for the filename
1. Use only full name in name fields. Nicknames can be used in body of profile. (eg. Salvation "Sally" Gatchalian)
1. Do not use GoFundMe pages as a `source`. Always use a legitimate news site as the official `source`. Feel free to include links to GoFundMe in the body.
1. Start the bio with "(Presumed)" individuals that are not confirmed to have died from the virus or related complications.
1. Do not use AMP URLs in the `source` or `body`. Always use the original URL.
